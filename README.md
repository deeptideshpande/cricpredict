# cricpredict
This project was created with an intention to predict the result of a Cricket match. There are a lot of improvements that need to be done. The best accuracy that I get now is 60%.

### Steps to use the project
1. scraper.py is used to scrape data from cricinfo. Enter the parameter values at the beginning of the script.
2. tester.py is used to test the prediction. Enter the paramter values at the beginning of the script.
3. Make sure that you create a sub-directory "data" before executing scraper.py
